      Learn how to use include directives to modularize your Spack YAML configuration files for better organization and reusability.

Include Settings (include.yaml)
===============================

Spack allows you to include configuration files through ``include.yaml``.
Using the ``include:`` heading results in pulling in external configuration information to be used by any Spack command.

Included configuration files are required *unless* they are explicitly optional or the entry's condition evaluates to ``false``.
Optional includes are specified with the ``optional`` clause and conditional ones with the ``when`` clause.
For example,

.. code-block:: yaml

   include:
   - /path/to/a/required/config.yaml
   - path: /path/to/$os/$target/config
     optional: true
   - path: /path/to/os-specific/config-dir
     when: os == "ventura"

shows all three.
The first entry, ``/path/to/a/required/config.yaml``, indicates that the included ``config.yaml`` file is required (so must exist).
Use of ``optional: true`` for ``/path/to/$os/$target/config`` means the path is only included if it exists.
The condition ``os == "ventura"`` in the ``when`` clause for ``/path/to/os-specific/config-dir`` means the path is only included when the operating system (``os``) is ``ventura``.

The same conditions and variables in `Spec List References <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#spec-list-references>`_ can be used for conditional activation in the ``when`` clauses.

Included files can be specified by path or by their parent directory.
Paths may be absolute, relative (to the configuration file including the path), or specified as URLs.
Only the ``file``, ``ftp``, ``http``, and ``https`` protocols (or schemes) are supported.
Spack-specific, environment and user path variables can be used.
(See :ref:`config-file-variables` for more information.)

A ``sha256`` is required for remote file URLs and must be specified as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

   include:
   - path: https://github.com/path/to/raw/config/compilers.yaml
     sha256: 26e871804a92cd07bb3d611b31b4156ae93d35b6a6d6e0ef3a67871fcb1d258b

Additionally, remote file URLs must link to the **raw** form of the file's contents (e.g., `GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-and-understanding-files#viewing-or-copying-the-raw-file-content>`_ or `GitLab <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/repository_files.html#get-raw-file-from-repository>`_).

.. warning::

   Recursive includes are not currently processed in a breadth-first manner, so the value of a configuration option that is altered by multiple included files may not be what you expect.
   This will be addressed in a future update.
