Package Repositories (repos.yaml)
=================================

Spack comes with thousands of built-in package recipes.
As of Spack v1.0, these are hosted in a separate Git repository at `spack/spack-packages <https://github.com/spack/spack-packages>`_.

A **package repository** is a directory that Spack searches when it needs to find a package by name.
You may need to maintain packages for restricted, proprietary, or experimental software separately from the built-in repository.
Spack allows you to configure local and remote repositories using either the ``repos.yaml`` configuration file or the ``spack repo`` command.

This document describes how to set up and manage these package repositories.

Structure of an Individual Package Repository
---------------------------------------------

An individual Spack package repository is a directory structured as follows:

.. code-block:: text

   /path/to/repos/                   # the top-level dir is added to the Python search path
     spack_repo/                     # every package repository is part of the spack_repo Python module
       myrepo/                       # directory for the 'myrepo' repository (matches namespace)
         repo.yaml                   # configuration file for this package repository
         packages/                   # directory containing package directories
           hdf5/                     # directory for the hdf5 package
             package.py              # the package recipe file
           mpich/                    # directory for the mpich package
             package.py              # the package recipe file
             mpich-1.9-bugfix.patch  # example patch file
           trilinos/
             package.py
       ...

* ``repo.yaml``.
  This file contains metadata for this specific repository, for example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    repo:
      namespace: myrepo
      api: v2.0

  It defines primarily:

  * ``namespace``.
    A unique identifier for this repository (e.g., ``myrepo``, ``projectx``).
    See the :ref:`Namespaces <namespaces>` section for more details.
  * ``api``.
    The version of the Spack Package API this repository adheres to (e.g., ``v2.0``).
    Spack itself defines what range of API versions it supports, and will error if it encounters a repository with an unsupported API version.

* ``packages/``.
  This directory contains subdirectories for each package in the repository.
  Each package directory contains a ``package.py`` file and any patches or other files needed to build the package.

Package repositories allow you to:

1. Maintain your own packages separately from Spack's built-in set.
2. Share your packages (e.g., by hosting them on a shared file system or in a Git repository) without committing them to the main ``spack/spack-packages`` repository.
3. Override built-in Spack packages with your own implementations.

Packages in a separate repository can also *depend on* built-in Spack packages, allowing you to leverage existing recipes without re-implementing them.

Package Names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Package names are defined by the directory names under ``packages/``.
In the example above, the package names are ``hdf5``, ``mpich``, and ``trilinos``.
Package names can only contain lowercase characters ``a-z``, digits ``0-9`` and hyphens ``-``.

.. note::

   Package names are **derived** from the directory names under ``packages/``.
   Package directories are required to be valid Python module names, which means they cannot contain hyphens or start with a digit.
   This means that a package named ``my-package`` would be stored in a directory named ``my_package/``, and a package named ``7zip`` would be stored in a directory named ``_7zip/`` with an underscore prefix to make it a valid Python module name.
   The mapping between package names and directory names is one-to-one.
   Use ``spack list`` to see how Spack resolves the package names from the directory names.

Configuring Repositories with ``repos.yaml``
--------------------------------------------

Spack uses ``repos.yaml`` files found in its :ref:`configuration scopes <configuration>` (e.g., ``~/.spack/``, ``etc/spack/``) to discover and prioritize package repositories.
Note that this ``repos.yaml`` (plural) configuration file is distinct from the ``repo.yaml`` (singular) file within each individual package repository.

Spack supports two main types of repository configurations:

Local Repositories (Path-based)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can point Spack to a repository on your local filesystem:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # Example: ~/.spack/repos.yaml
  repos:
    my_local_packages: /path/to/my_repository_root

Here, ``/path/to/my_repository_root`` should be the directory containing that repository's ``repo.yaml`` and ``packages/`` subdirectory.

Git-based Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spack can clone and use repositories directly from Git URLs:

.. code-block:: yaml

  repos:
    my_remote_repo: https://github.com/myorg/spack-custom-pkgs.git

**Automatic Cloning.**
When Spack first encounters a Git-based repository configuration, it automatically clones it.
By default, these repositories are cloned into a subdirectory within ``~/.spack/package_repos/``, named with a hash of the repository URL.

To change directories to the package repository, you can use ``spack cd --repo [name]``.
To find where a repository is cloned, you can use ``spack location --repo [name]`` or ``spack repo list``.
The ``name`` argument is optional; if omitted, Spack will use the first package repository in configuration order.

**Customizing Clone Location.**
The default clone location (``~/.spack/package_repos/<hashed_name>``) might not be convenient for package maintainers who want to make changes to packages.
You can specify a custom local directory for Spack to clone a Git repository into, or to use if the repository is already cloned there.
This is done using the ``destination`` key in ``repos.yaml`` or via the ``spack repo set --destination`` command (see :ref:`cmd-spack-repo-set-destination`).

For example, to use ``~/custom_packages_clone`` for ``my_remote_repo``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # ~/.spack/repos.yaml
  repos:
    my_remote_repo:
      git: https://github.com/myorg/spack-custom-pkgs.git
      destination: ~/custom_packages_clone

If the ``git`` URL is defined in a lower-precedence configuration (like Spack's defaults for ``builtin``), you only need to specify the ``destination`` in your user-level ``repos.yaml``.
Spack can make the configuration changes for you using ``spack repo set --destination ~/spack-packages builtin``, or you can directly edit your ``repos.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # ~/.spack/repos.yaml
  repos:
    builtin:
      destination: ~/spack-packages

**Updating and pinning.**
Repos can be pinned to a git branch, tag, or commit.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # ~/.spack/repos.yaml
   repos:
     builtin:
       branch: releases/v2025.07
       # tag: v2025.07.0
       # commit: 6427933daecef74b981d1f773731aeace3b06ede

The ``spack repo update`` command will update the repo on disk to match the current state of the config.
If the repo is pinned to a commit or tag, it will ensure the repo on disk reflects that commit or tag.
If the repo is pinned to a branch or unpinned, ``spack repo update`` will pull the most recent state of the branch (the default branch if unpinned).

**Git repositories need a package repo index.**
A single Git repository can contain one or more Spack package repositories.
To enable Spack to discover these, the root of the Git repository should contain a ``spack-repo-index.yaml`` file.
This file lists the relative paths to package repository roots within the git repo.

For example, assume a Git repository at ``https://example.com/my_org/my_pkgs.git`` has the following structure

.. code-block:: text

   my_pkgs.git/
     spack-repo-index.yaml     # metadata file at the root of the Git repo
     ...
     spack_pkgs/
       spack_repo/
         my_org/
           comp_sci_packages/  # package repository for computer science packages
             repo.yaml
             packages/
               hdf5/
                 package.py
               mpich/
                 package.py
           physics_packages/   # package repository for physics packages
             repo.yaml
             packages/
               gromacs/
                 package.py

The ``spack-repo-index.yaml`` in the root of ``https://example.com/my_org/my_pkgs.git`` should look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # my_pkgs.git/spack-repo-index.yaml
  repo_index:
    paths:
    - spack_pkgs/spack_repo/my_org/comp_sci_packages
    - spack_pkgs/spack_repo/my_org/physics_packages

If ``my_pkgs.git`` is configured in ``repos.yaml`` as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # ~/.spack/repos.yaml
  repos:
    example_mono_repo: https://example.com/my_org/my_pkgs.git

Spack will clone ``my_pkgs.git`` and look for ``spack-repo-index.yaml``.
It will then register two separate repositories based on the paths found (e.g., ``<clone_dir>/spack_pkgs/spack_repo/my_org/comp_sci_packages`` and ``<clone_dir>/spack_pkgs/spack_repo/my_org/physics_packages``), each with its own namespace defined in its respective ``repo.yaml`` file.
Thus, one ``repos.yaml`` entry for a Git mono-repo can lead to *multiple repositories* being available to Spack.

If you want only one of the package repositories from a Git mono-repo, you can override the paths in your user-level ``repos.yaml``.
For example, if you only want the computer science packages:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # ~/.spack/repos.yaml
   repos:
     example_mono_repo:
       git: https://example.com/my_org/my_pkgs.git
       paths:
       - spack_pkgs/spack_repo/my_org/comp_sci_packages

The ``spack repo add`` command can help you set up these configurations easily.

The ``builtin`` Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spack's extensive collection of built-in packages resides at `spack/spack-packages <https://github.com/spack/spack-packages>`_.
By default, Spack is configured to use this as a Git-based repository.
The default configuration in ``$spack/etc/spack/defaults/repos.yaml`` looks something like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

  repos:
    builtin:
      git: https://github.com/spack/spack-packages.git

.. _namespaces:

Namespaces
----------

Every repository in Spack has an associated **namespace** defined in the ``namespace:`` key of its top-level ``repo.yaml`` file.
For example, the built-in repository (from ``spack/spack-packages``) has its namespace defined as ``builtin``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # In spack/spack-packages repository's repo.yaml
  repo:
    namespace: builtin
    api: v2.0 # Or newer

Spack records the repository namespace of each installed package.
For example, if you install the ``mpich`` package from the ``builtin`` repo, Spack records its fully qualified name as ``builtin.mpich``.
This accomplishes two things:

1.  You can have packages with the same name from different namespaces installed simultaneously.
2.  You can easily determine which repository a package came from after it is installed (more :ref:`below <namespace-example>`).

.. note::

   The ``namespace`` defined in the package repository's ``repo.yaml`` is the **authoritative source** for the namespace.
   It is *not* derived from the local configuration in ``repos.yaml``.
   This means that the namespace is determined by the repository maintainer, not by the user or local configuration.

Nested Namespaces for Organizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we have already seen in the Git-based package repositories example above, you can create nested namespaces by using periods in the namespace name.
For example, a repository for packages related to computation at LLNL might have the namespace ``llnl.comp``, while one for physical and life sciences could be ``llnl.pls``.
On the file system, this requires a directory structure like this:

.. code-block:: text

   /path/to/repos/
     spack_repo/
       llnl/
         comp/
           repo.yaml  # Contains namespace: llnl.comp
           packages/
             mpich/
               package.py
         pls/
           repo.yaml  # Contains namespace: llnl.pls
           packages/
             hdf5/
               package.py

Uniqueness
^^^^^^^^^^

Spack cannot ensure global uniqueness of all namespaces, but it will prevent you from registering two repositories with the same namespace *at the same time* in your current configuration.
If you try to add a repository that has the same namespace as an already registered one, Spack will print a warning and may ignore the new addition or apply specific override logic depending on the configuration.

.. _namespace-example:

Namespace Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suppose LLNL maintains its own version of ``mpich`` (in a repository with namespace ``llnl.comp``), separate from Spack's built-in ``mpich`` package (namespace ``builtin``).
If you've installed both, ``spack find`` alone might be ambiguous:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack find
  ==> 2 installed packages.
  -- linux-rhel6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -------------
  mpich@3.2  mpich@3.2

Using ``spack find -N`` displays packages with their namespaces:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack find -N
  ==> 2 installed packages.
  -- linux-rhel6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -------------
  builtin.mpich@3.2  llnl.comp.mpich@3.2

Now you can distinguish them.
Packages differing only by namespace will have different hashes:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack find -lN
  ==> 2 installed packages.
  -- linux-rhel6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.7 -------------
  c35p3gc builtin.mpich@3.2  itoqmox llnl.comp.mpich@3.2

All Spack commands that take a package :ref:`spec <sec-specs>` also accept a fully qualified spec with a namespace, allowing you to be specific:

.. code-block:: spec

  $ spack uninstall llnl.comp.mpich

Search Order and Overriding Packages
-------------------------------------

When Spack resolves an unqualified package name (e.g., ``mpich`` in ``spack install mpich``), it searches the configured repositories in the order they appear in the *merged* ``repos.yaml`` configuration (from highest to lowest precedence scope, and top to bottom within each file).
The first repository found that provides the package will be used.
For Git-based mono-repos, the individual repositories listed in its ``spack-repo-index.yaml`` are effectively inserted into this search order based on the mono-repo's position.

This search order allows you to override built-in packages.
If you have your own ``mpich`` in a repository ``my_custom_repo``, and ``my_custom_repo`` is listed before ``builtin`` in your ``repos.yaml``, Spack will use your version of ``mpich`` by default.

Suppose your effective (merged) ``repos.yaml`` implies the following order:

1. ``proto`` (local repo at ``~/my_spack_repos/spack_repo/proto_repo``)
2. ``llnl`` (local repo at ``/usr/local/repos/spack_repo/llnl_repo``)
3. ``builtin`` (Spack's default packages from ``spack/spack-packages``)

And the packages are:

+--------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Namespace    | Source                                         | Packages                    |
+==============+================================================+=============================+
| ``proto``    | ``~/my_spack_repos/spack_repo/proto_repo``     | ``mpich``                   |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| ``llnl``     | ``/usr/local/repos/spack_repo/llnl_repo``      | ``hdf5``                    |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| ``builtin``  | `spack/spack-packages` (Git)                   | ``mpich``, ``hdf5``, others |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

If ``hdf5`` depends on ``mpich``:

* ``spack install hdf5`` will install ``llnl.hdf5 ^proto.mpich``.
  Spack finds ``hdf5`` first in ``llnl``.
  For its dependency ``mpich``, Spack searches again from the top, finding ``mpich`` first in ``proto``.

You can force a particular repository's package using a fully qualified name:

* ``spack install hdf5 ^builtin.mpich`` will install ``llnl.hdf5 ^builtin.mpich``.
* ``spack install builtin.hdf5 ^builtin.mpich`` will install ``builtin.hdf5 ^builtin.mpich``.

To see which repositories will be used for a build *before* installing, use ``spack spec -N``:

.. code-block:: spec

   $ spack spec -N hdf5
   llnl.hdf5@1.10.0
       ^proto.mpich@3.2
       ^builtin.zlib@1.2.8

.. warning::

   While you *can* use a fully qualified package name in a ``depends_on`` directive within a ``package.py`` file (e.g., ``depends_on("proto.hdf5")``), this is **strongly discouraged**.
   It makes the package non-portable and tightly coupled to a specific repository configuration, hindering sharing and composition of repositories.
   A package will fail to load if the hardcoded namespace's repository is not registered.

.. _cmd-spack-repo:

The ``spack repo`` Command
--------------------------

Spack provides commands to manage your repository configurations.

.. _cmd-spack-repo-list:

``spack repo list``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command shows all repositories Spack currently knows about, including their namespace, API version, and resolved path (local path or clone directory for Git repos).

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack repo list
  [+] my_local           v2.0    /path/to/spack_repo/my_local_packages
  [+] comp_sci_packages  v2.0    ~/.spack/package_repos/<hash 1>/spack_pkgs/spack_repo/comp_sci_packages
  [+] physics_packages   v2.0    ~/.spack/package_repos/<hash 1>/spack_pkgs/spack_repo/physics_packages  # From the same git repo
  [+] builtin            v2.0    ~/.spack/package_repos/<hash 2>/repos/spack_repo/builtin

Spack shows a green ``[+]`` next to each repository that is available for use.
It shows a red ``[-]`` to indicate that package repositories cannot be used due to an error (e.g., unsupported API version, missing ``repo.yaml``, etc.).
It can also show just a gray ``-`` if it is a Git-based package repository that has not been cloned yet.

Note that for Git-based package repositories, ``spack repo list`` will show entries for *each* individual package repository registered via ``spack-repo-index.yaml``.
This contrasts with ``spack config get repos``, which shows the raw configuration from ``repos.yaml`` files, including just the Git URL for a mono-repo:

.. code-block:: console

   $ spack config get repos
   repos:
     my_local_packages: /path/to/spack_repo/my_local_packages
     example_mono_repo: https://example.com/my_org/my_pkgs.git # contains two package repositories
     builtin:
       git: https://github.com/spack/spack-packages.git
       # destination: /my/custom/path (if set by user)

.. _cmd-spack-repo-create:

``spack repo create``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create the directory structure for a new, empty local repository:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack repo create ~/my_spack_projects myorg.projectx
  ==> Created repo with namespace 'myorg.projectx'.
  ==> To register it with spack, run this command:
    spack repo add ~/my_spack_projects/spack_repo/myorg/projectx

This command creates the following structure:

.. code-block:: text

   ~/my_spack_projects/
     spack_repo/
       myorg/
         projectx/
           repo.yaml      # Contains namespace: myorg.projectx
           packages/      # Empty directory for new package.py files

The ``<target_dir>`` is where the ``spack_repo/<namespace_parts>`` hierarchy will be created.
The ``<namespace>`` can be simple (e.g., ``myrepo``) or nested (e.g., ``myorg.projectx``), and Spack will create the corresponding directory structure.

.. _cmd-spack-repo-add:

``spack repo add``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To register package repositories from local paths or a remote Git repositories with Spack:

* **For a local path:** Provide the path to the repository's root directory (the one containing ``repo.yaml`` and ``packages/``).

  .. code-block:: console

     $ spack repo add ~/my_spack_projects/spack_repo/myorg/projectx
     ==> Added repo to config with name 'myorg.projectx'.

* **For a Git repository:** Provide the Git URL.

  .. code-block:: console

     $ spack repo add --name my_pkgs https://github.com/spack/spack-packages.git ~/my_pkgs
     Cloning into '/home/user/my_pkgs'...
     ==> Added repo to config with name 'my_pkgs'.

  Notice that for Git-based package repositories, you need to specify a configuration name explicitly, which is the key used in your ``repos.yaml`` configuration file.
  The example also shows providing a custom destination path ``~/my_pkgs``.
  You can omit this if you want Spack to use the default clone location (e.g., ``~/.spack/package_repos/<hashed_name>``).

After adding, packages from this repository should appear in ``spack list`` and be installable.

.. _cmd-spack-repo-remove:

``spack repo remove``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To unregister a repository, use its configuration name (the key in ``repos.yaml``) or its local path.

By configuration name (e.g., ``projectx`` from the add example):

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack repo remove projectx
  ==> Removed repository 'projectx'.

By path (for a local repo):

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack repo remove ~/my_spack_projects/spack_repo/myorg/projectx
  ==> Removed repository '/home/user/my_spack_projects/spack_repo/myorg/projectx'.

This command removes the corresponding entry from your ``repos.yaml`` configuration.
It does *not* delete the local repository files or any cloned Git repositories.

.. _cmd-spack-repo-set-destination:

``spack repo set``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Git-based repositories, this command allows you to specify a custom local directory where Spack should clone the repository, or use an existing clone.
The ``<config_name>`` is the key used in your ``repos.yaml`` file for that Git repository (e.g., ``builtin``, ``my_remote_repo``).

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack repo set --destination /my/custom/path/for/spack-packages builtin
  ==> Updated repo 'builtin'

This updates your user-level ``repos.yaml``, adding or modifying the ``destination:`` key for the specified repository configuration name.

.. code-block:: yaml

  # ~/.spack/repos.yaml after the command
  repos:
    builtin:
      destination: /my/custom/path/for/spack-packages
      # The 'git:' URL is typically inherited from Spack's default configuration for 'builtin'

Spack will then use ``/my/custom/path/for/spack-packages`` for the ``builtin`` repository.
If the directory doesn't exist, Spack will clone into it.
If it exists and is a valid Git repository, Spack will use it.

Repository Namespaces and Python
--------------------------------

Package repositories in Spack (from ``api: v2.0`` or newer) are structured to integrate smoothly with Python's import system.
They are effectively Python namespace packages under the top-level ``spack_repo`` namespace.

The ``api: v2.0`` repository structure ensures that packages can be imported using a standard Python module path: ``spack_repo.<namespace>.packages.<package_name>.package``.
For instance, the ``mpich`` package from the ``builtin`` repository corresponds to the Python module ``spack_repo.builtin.packages.mpich.package``.

This allows you to easily extend or subclass package classes from other repositories in your own ``package.py`` files:

.. code-block:: python

   # In a package file (e.g. my_custom_mpich/package.py) in your custom repo
   # Import the original Mpich class from the 'builtin' repository
   from spack_repo.builtin.packages.mpich.package import Mpich as BuiltinMpich


   class MyCustomMpich(BuiltinMpich):
       # Override versions, variants, or methods from BuiltinMpich
       version("3.5-custom", sha256="...")

       # Add a new variant
       variant("custom_feature", default=False, description="Enable my custom feature")

       def install(self, spec, prefix):
           if "+custom_feature" in spec:
               # Do custom things
               pass
           super().install(spec, prefix)  # Call parent install method

Spack manages Python's ``sys.path`` at runtime to make these imports discoverable across all registered repositories.
This capability is powerful for creating derivative packages or slightly modifying existing ones without copying entire package files.
